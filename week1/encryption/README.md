# Encryption

Encryption is the process of converting plaintext data into an unreadable format, called ciphertext, using a specific algorithm and a key. The data can be decrypted back to its original form only with the appropriate key.

### Key Characteristics:

Reversible: With the correct key, the ciphertext can be decrypted back to plaintext.
Key-dependent: The security of encryption relies on the secrecy of the key.

## Types of Encryption

There are two main types of encryption:

1. **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.

   - Examples: AES, DES, 3DES
   - Pros: Fast, efficient for large amounts of data
   - Cons: Key distribution can be challenging

2. **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a pair of keys - a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
   - Examples: RSA, ECC, DSA
   - Pros: Solves key distribution problem, provides digital signatures
   - Cons: Slower than symmetric encryption
