# Brief History Of Money

## Origin of Money

### Barter System

Direct exchange of goods and services without using money.

### Commodity Money

Cattle, grains, and shells was used as money.

## Metals and Coins

### Metal Money

Metals such as gold, silver and bronze used as money.
Mesopotamia used silver as a standard of value around 3000 BCE.

### Coins

First appeared in the ancient Kingdom of Lydia (modern-day Turkey) around the 6th century BCE. Made from electrum, a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver, and were stamped with the image of the ruling monarch.

## Paper Money

### Early Paper Money

Receipts for deposits of precious metals or other valuable commodities held by wealthy merchants or the imperial treasury.

Paper money was introduced in China during the Tang Dynasty (7th century) and widespread in the Song Dynasty (11th century).

### Bank notes

Early banks like the Bank of England began issuing paper money backed by gold reserves. In 1661, Sweden became the first European country to issue standardized banknotes, followed by England in 1694 with the establishment of the Bank of England.<br/>
Prominent in Europe during the 17th century.

### The Modern Gold Standard (17th - 19th Centuries)

The modern gold standard emerged in the 17th century, with England being the first country to officially adopt the gold standard in 1717. Over the following centuries, many other countries followed suit, including the United States (1879), Germany (1871), and France (1878).

### The Classical Gold Standard (1870s - 1914)

The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw the widespread adoption of the classical gold standard. During this period, countries pegged their currencies to a fixed amount of gold, and the free flow of gold between countries helped maintain the stability of exchange rates.
The gold standard became widely adopted by major economies, including the UK, Germany, the U.S., and others. It allowed for fixed exchange rates between currencies and facilitated international trade.

### The Interwar Period (1914 - 1944)

World War I disrupted the classical gold standard, as countries suspended the convertibility of their currencies to gold in order to finance the war effort, leading to inflation.

After the war, some countries attempted to return to the gold standard during the 1920s, but it led to economic instability, particularly during the Great Depression. The rigid nature of the gold standard made it difficult for governments to respond to economic crises.

### Bretton Woods System (1944 - 1971)

In 1944, as World War II was ending, the Bretton Woods Conference established a new international monetary system. The U.S. dollar was pegged to gold at $35 per ounce(28.35gm), while other currencies were pegged to the dollar.

The U.S. dollar became the world's primary reserve currency, and countries held dollars as part of their reserves. This system required the U.S. to maintain significant gold reserves to back its currency.

### Fiat Money : The End of the Gold Standard (1971 - Present)

Money without intrinsic value but accepted by government.

By the 1960s, the U.S. faced significant economic challenges, including the cost of the Vietnam War and domestic spending, leading to a depletion of gold reserves. Other countries began converting their dollars to gold, causing a run on U.S. gold reserves.

On August 15, 1971, President Richard Nixon announced the suspension of the dollar's convertibility into gold, effectively ending the Bretton Woods system and the global gold standard. This event is known as the "Nixon Shock."

Since then, most countries have adopted fiat money systems, where the value of currencies is not directly linked to gold or any other commodity.

### The End
