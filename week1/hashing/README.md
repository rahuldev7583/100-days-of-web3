# Hash

## Overview

This project provides a simple implementation of hashing algorithms, with a focus on SHA256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit).

## What is Hashing?

Hashing is a process of converting input data of arbitrary size into a fixed-size string of characters. The output, called a hash value or digest, is typically a hexadecimal number.

## Key features of hashing include:

1. The same input always produces the same output.
2. It's computationally infeasible to reverse a hash to obtain the original input.
3. A small change in the input results in a significantly different output.

Hashing is used in various applications, including:

- Data integrity - Verifying the data has not been altered.
- Cryptography- Securing data, Passwords, encrypting messages
- Digital signatures - Ensuring that a message has not been altered.

## SHA256

SHA
SHA256 is part of the SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) family, designed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). Key features of SHA256 include:

- Produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value
- Typically represented as a 64-character hexadecimal number
- Widely used in security applications and protocols
